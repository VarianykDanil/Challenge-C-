/**
 * Release 1.3 — OWNED BY P1 pay-rule (laid down empty by r3-foundation). This package's audit specs: one entry per write
 * route it adds, in the shape of lib/auditSpecs.ts (AuditRouteSpec: method, pattern, before, after → AuditDraft[]),
 * registered through ./registry.ts (P9 owns the registry; this file is the only one this package edits for audit).
 * P9's coverage test fails for any write route without a spec. Routes to cover:
 * POST /pay/bonuses, POST /pay/adjustments, DELETE /pay/adjustments/:id, PUT /pay/settings, POST /pay/rates.
 * Snapshots never include PINs, passwords, app passwords, secrets, tokens or codes (lib/audit.ts redacts again).
